# Manor Advisor - Helping you take pride in home ownership, or saving on your deposit <br />
https://manor-advisor.herokuapp.com/ <br />
This approachable application provides an overview of exterior and interior components to be maintained and cleaned. Not all items apply to a person's dwelling, so simply cross them out. Don't be overwhelmed by all the tasks, but get comfortable with thinking about the components that deserve some care. Try what you can, take interest in more and see how your relationship with home care can flourish!<br />
